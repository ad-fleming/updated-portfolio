                            I'm Alex. I live in Atlanta, GA with my wife, our two dogs, Gizmo and Milly, and our cat (trash gremlin), Sox. I'm currently hard at study to become a full-stack web developer after deciding to mix it up after being on the other side of the recruiting desk. I have background working across multiple industries including Insurance, Mortgage and Banking, as well as Staffing. I'm a mixed bag that likes a quiet space and a busy mind. I enjoy reading, fishing, watching football, learning, and trying new things. 2020 has been pivotal in so many ways for so many people. After some hard knocks, I decided to seize an opportunity to explore the world of web development and I could not be happier.

                            I'm rapidly acquiring skills in Front, and Back End Web Development, and hope to find myself on a new journey professionally. Please check out my portfolio page to take a look at what I've been up to, and if you'd like to get in touch, please contact me via my contact page!

              <!-- Used class of footer-copyright after googling footer control. This has a built in styling to position the footer to bottom. I then used the the CSS calc() function to style the <main> height to be 100% of the viewport height - (height of navbar) - (height of the footer)
                I beleive the same could be accomplished by using CSS to make your own custom footer and then placing it to an Absolute, bottom 0 position, RELATIVE to the body and then setting a min-height of 100% of the viewport to the body, in addition to adding a padding the same height as your custom footer??-->
